       " 'wow, okay, i sense an amazon.com equivalent of an egging or a tp party coming on, because if i am to honestly review demonfire, it\\'s not going to be nearly a flattering a the majority of other reviewers. paranormal romance and urban fantasy are my two favorite book genres. i read and i review a lot of them. i\\'ve come to realize that i\\'m usually pretty forgiving of minor issue or singular issue - for example, if it\\'s a decent story but not technically all that well told, i may give it a three stars, but explain in my review what the critical aspect are. i understand and accept that i hold my favorite genre to a higher standard - rightly or wrongly - than other genre and that ultimately i want to be entertained. i believe that if i\\'m not entertained given that the genre predisposes me to being entertained, then there\\'s a big problem somewhere.i wa not entertained by demonfire.my apology to kate douglas, who i\\'ve enjoyed a an erotic paranormal romance author, but frankly, i found the character in demonfire to be two-dimensional and the narrative to be repetitive, inexplicable, and at time heavy-handed. eddy and dax seemed cardboard and flat, and unfortunately, so did the entire impetus behind their relationship. the abrupt way they were thrown together felt too contrived and put a heavy strain on my suspension of disbelief (not even dax could understand how he got into eddy\\'s shed from the portal he came through, so how could i?). when those issue combined with the perplexing mythology of the lemurians to explain altan\\'s character and presence, the first quarter of the book felt like a cross between a snore and a quagmire of implausibility. to be honest, the pitbull/poodle mixed-breed canine wa more fleshed out with a more believable and sympathetic backstory than two third of the book\\'s main characters, and that\\'s a problem.dax is a former demon (now reincarnated/reanimated/newly de-demonized-sorta/former soldier boy) with a tattoo on his body that will come back to bite him...or try to again and again and again. eddy is a human reporter who is willing to toss her job and fight demon she didn\\'t even believe in yesterday. no convincing and little to no explanation needed. she find out her touch soothes dax\\'s demonic curse...with no explanation and little to no coherent reason given. altan is the ancient lemurian who gave up his millennia-old and immortal life in the cavern of a currently inactive volcano (or other dimension...i wasn\\'t too clear on that - could be both, i suppose, though i\\'m not sure why the volcano would exist in both dimensions). the part of the story concerning that race and altan\\'s decision wa anorexic in plot and very nebulous in the narrative, and i had a big problem with altan\\'s excellent grasp of modern american vernacular, technology, and cultural references, considering the written mythology. toss in the dog bumper, a will-o\\'-wisp tinkerbell-sort willow (my favorite character through most of the book), and ed, eddy\\'s father (by far the most interesting and believable character) and you have the core group that fight the big bad demons...who really aren\\'t so big or bad, given that they\\'re animating garden gnome and other kitschy lawn statuary...except for the gargoyle - but you\\'ll have to read that for yourself.the problem with the book aren\\'t just in the characters. the world douglas is trying to create here never really snapped into solid focus for me. too many shifting descriptives and inexplicable happenstance. the book\\'s main conflict, the threat of the big bad and smaller baddie wa bizarrely non-threatening (you could\\'ve had a \"no human were hurt during the writing of this book\" disclaimer). and then there wa the repetition.dax wa given a human (sorta) body for one week to fight the demon slipping from abyss. after the protagonist get together, the book count down the rest of dax\\'s seven day and at some point in each one of those remaining day the fact he\\'s only got six... five... four... three... two day left is given a lot of room in the story to explain in mind-numbing detail just how sucky it is for all concerned that dax only ha that much time left. and this melodrama went on each and every day, over and over and over again. repetitively.i don\\'t think that\\'s compelling plot, nor do i feel that it engenders any sense of true tension, because a the reader i know going in that it\\'s a paranormal romance and dax and eddy are going to get their hea. otherwise it\\'d be called shakespeare. lamenting for page after page about them being separated for eternity just becomes tedious and (dare i be repetitive?) repetitive. i\\'ve read excellent paranormal romance series that deal with this subject and it\\'s always the ingenuity and originality of how the lead get their hea that impress me. i already know they\\'re going to. so by the end, when i wa at least hoping for a glimmer of originality in the way eddy and dax stay together, i wa ultimately disappointed again. i won\\'t give spoilers...but it wa just...not well done.so why the two stars, given how much it sound like i hated it? because i didn\\'t hate it. maybe i wa too ambivalent about it to hate it. maybe that\\'s worse. but mostly the two star are because there were a few tiny glimmer of hope. kate douglas doe write reasonably sensual sex scenes, and what little chemistry there wa between dax and eddy shined brightest during them. i think it\\'s hard sometimes to go from writing erotic novel to toning down the sex for a mass market audience, and i think that demonfire wa well represented in that regard. i think some people are going to think it wa too graphic or explicit, but i\\'m not one of them. i also sort of ended up liking altan. i still don\\'t get why he talked in such a modern and culturally human fashion, but i thought he wa sort of endearing with the sword that refused to speak to him and the crush he get on ginny. and that is why i will give kate douglas another chance. the second book in this series is due out later this year, and according to the sneak peak, altan is off to sedona where he sent ginny to save her from what wa going on...only to get a call that thing in sedona are even worse, a live animal are being possessed by demon and attacking their owner and neighbor and the like. and ginny is stubbornly aware of altan\\'s machination with mind control, despite altan\\'s best efforts. i think it sound fun. and ginny, for her few minute of face time in the book, struck me a a more layered and spunky character than eddy ever did. i\\'m looking forward to reading about them. we\\'ll see.',\n",

(i don't think i'm the first review to point either aspect out.) i didn't care for the h though. the h, i might point out, who isn't even important enough to have her own name in the book's description, so you can imagine how much effect she ha in the book. no, despite liking many of the disparate part of the book i didn't like the book a a whole. others do. i can't say i cared much for it.\",\n",

(2%).\"it is in this environment that young selena wa raised, living with her parent on the run. lucky for her, her mother wa a nurse and her father an anthropologist, so she wa able to learn survival skill from them, including becoming a leatherworker. after her parent have passed, selena life like a ghost in the shadows, deftly avoiding human contact. in the time of anarchy, other human are a threat, not only because they would rob her, but could also threaten her virtue.eventually she run into dan... the son of a special force unit military officer who \"convinces\" the young lady to come with him and join a small hidden community of nice human who have banded together. selena ha been far too long without human contact and it take her time to learn to grapple with the struggle of living with others but she eventually find her place.as much a i enjoyed this novel... i\\'d say it wa only good (not great) because it wa marketed a a romance and it just wasn\\'t very romantic. there is absolutely no pov from dan, the hero, and the story is almost entirely from the perspective of selena. dan is silent and unreadable and for the most of the novel, since we\\'re not told what he\\'s thinking even from his inner dialogue, there is little to no interaction between the two characters. at the point that the heroine provoked the hero into chasing her (which is all they do... she runs, he chases... the one time he doesn\\'t chase she\\'s disappointed...) anyway, by the time the love scene come i wasn\\'t convinced the two had fallen in love or why. they\\'d literally exchanged only a few sentence to each other. literally. i wa also disappointed that the heroine said \"no\" and \"i hate you\" to the hero when they made love. not very romantic. after this love scene, they resort back to having little interaction with each other until the end.beyond that, i kept wondering where all the human had gone. the crash doesn\\'t explain why there is mass loss of life. this novel read a though there had been a nuclear fallout or a plague or something... leaving only remnant human to and large city completely abandoned. the only explanation is that human died off because they were so dumb... when the can and food ran out in the store after being ransacked, they just didn\\'t know what to do. somehow this just didn\\'t seem right to me. the whole explanation for the crash just seemed a little flimsy. financial global failure? hmmmm.but overall, the story wa good and the price wa right.love scenes: 2environment: american southwest/ future/ apocalypticstory themes: tortured heroine, tortured hero, kidnapping, rescue, love/hate relationship, survival',\n",

       " '3.5 star for this short, enjoyable, explicit romance. trope include revenge, abandonment, and insta-love. it\\'s cloaked a science fiction, but it\\'s romance. a such, it\\'s just fine, but i much prefer andrews\\' straight-up urban fantasies. it\\'s not that i dislike romance -- sometimes that\\'s exactly what i want (but not from team andrews).this is book 1 of the kinsman series. book 2 is out, too. my main problem with silent blade is the insta-love trope. it didn\\'t work for me, so then the sex didn\\'t move me either. the relationship development relied on sex too much, maybe? i am guessing the length (42 pages) constrained the authors.setting: another world, inhabited by human with special implant and ruled by a few different kinsman or kin family who have special inborn powers. (think mafia family ruling their financial empires, killing off the competition.)characters: the hero (celino carvannas) is a rich and ruthless kinsman, good with knives, 32 year old, \"tall, lean, and overwhelmingly masculine\" (of course). the heroine (meli galdes) is an outcast kinsman, excised from her family, and -- because of her ability to slay instantly with an energy ribbon -- she ha become a world-class assassin.plot: meli\\'s family asked her to do one last killing for them (even though she\\'s been excised for 12 years, she still doe their dirty work??) celino is the target. we are never told exactly why they want him dead, but i suppose it\\'s because his business is outperforming their business.but there\\'s a twist to this assassination assignment. she know her target. she wa only 10 when their joint parents, seeking to combine power, arranged for the two to become engaged. he wa 16. she studied him, a a good wife-in-waiting should do in this feudal society, and in the course of learning, she crushed, pinning all her hope and dream on him. but at age 22 (to her 16) he broke the engagement -- not kindly or tactfully at all -- causing her to become untouchable, an outcast, eventually an assassin.when they meet again 12 year later he doesn\\'t recognize her, because she wa always veiled in the past. insta-luv! he strode into the kitchen in the restaurant, smelled her passion cone (talkin\\' biscuits!), saw her lush curves, met her rich coffee-brown eyes...after he left, meli smiled with satisfaction. \"it took almost 18 years, from the skinny 10-year-old girl to the 28-year old woman, but mother proved right. she hit him like a brick.\"so....will she kill him, or won\\'t she? will he figure out that she\\'s the girl he tossed to the curb? if so, will he suffer and grovel? (i do like a good grovel).not much action. minimal suspense. not much to make it qualify a sci-fi or paranormal. this is a romance novel, with explicit sex and several reference to honey and breasts. the language is clean. not much violence. nothing gory.',\n",
